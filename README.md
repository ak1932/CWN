# CWN
coz why not

this is a series of projects which I underestimate the difficulty of while severely overestimating my skill.

there is no point to these projects except for me to have fun.

there are no promises to these projects so expect them to be unstable/broken/works on my machine/hazardous/deadly/a ticking time bomb/a button to launch a nuclear warhead in the hands of a 6 year old.

## Project numero uno - RLOX
a compiler written in rust inspired by the book crafting interpreters which creates a compiler in java(hehe, not doing that) and c.
I try to read the book and using rust instead of c.
